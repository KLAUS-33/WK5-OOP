# 🦸‍♂️ Superhero & Vehicle Python Project

This Python project demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts such as:

- ✅ Class & Object Creation  
- ✅ Constructors (`__init__`)
- ✅ Inheritance
- ✅ Polymorphism

---

## 📌 Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class

We created a class called `Superhero` with attributes like `name`, `power`, and `city`.  
We also extended it using inheritance by creating a subclass `FlyingSuperhero` that adds flying capability with an `altitude`.

### 🔍 Features:
- `introduce()` – Introduces the superhero.
- `fly()` – Shows flying ability (available in `FlyingSuperhero` only).

---

## 🎭 Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge

We created a base class `Vehicle` and derived three classes: `Car`, `Plane`, and `Boat`.  
Each class overrides the `move()` method to show a unique type of movement.

### 🛠 Technologies Used:
- Python 3
- Object-Oriented Programming
